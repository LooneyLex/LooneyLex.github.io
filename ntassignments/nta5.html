            The incarnation is one of the primary elements that we find in the Gospels - the belief that God became man (human). It is one of the central mysteries of the Christian faith.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the readings for this week, write a two paragraph essay that addresses the following two questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. How does the angel Gabriel address Mary in the annunciation and what do you think is the significance of this?
        </p>
        <p>
            2  What are the implications of the belief in the incarnation for how we might live or worship? Why is this event considered to be at the center of human history?
        </p>
        <p>
            Mary finding favor with God is really cool, and it implies that giving birth to Jesus is a privilege.
            Which makes sense. If not for Jesus, Mary would have just been a very nice woman, eventually
            forgotten to time. Now because she found God favor, she gets to be immortalized as a saint and talked
            about every mothers day until the end of time. The whole virgin conception thing is cool, as it really
            shows Gods powers. Like, how did he even do that? Godly powers, man. Doubling back on the favor
            thing, how does one find favor was God? Did Mary just like pray a lot, and He was like “Yup, this girl
            is gonna do it”? That would be wild.
        </p>
        <p>
            If all this is to be taken at face value, I think Mary should most certainly be talked about more.
            She seems obviously very important to God, and I think what he likes should be important to his
            followers. Not to say she should be worshiped. The Bible is really clear that we only worship God. It
            might be reassuring to people that ordinary folk, like Mary, can find so much favor with God he weaves
            them into his divine narrative. I’m not quite sure why someone put it at the center of human history. If
            the faith is important to your understanding of human history, then obviously I can see why its
            important. It was the day God was confirmed to be on his way in human for, which has massive
            implications for history if you take it at face value. God walked, talked, and chilled on the planet that
            we all hang out on. This is all if you’re taking the Bible as a historical source, of course. It’s interesting
            that not even Jesus’ birth, but the mere idea that he’s coming soon, is enough for Advent and all that.
            Even if you don’t think Jesus was all that, I mean BC and AD are how we tell time, and this is about
            the time we switch, so that’s really important to history.        </p>
