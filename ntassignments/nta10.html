            The early -like early early- church had to wrestle with if a gentile had to become a Jew in order
            to be a Christian. This doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, until you remember all the things that
            come with being traditionally Jewish. Circumcisions, dietary laws, and other traditional Jewish
            practices must be followed; however, do Christians need to do this stuff too? The issue was
            discussed by the higher ups -AKA those who were close with Jesus- in Jerusalem. They ended
            up coming to the conclusion that faith and grace are the necessary parts to be a follower of
            Jesus, not the law. That’s not to say one should totally disregard the law. A lot of what the law
            says is generally good and moral practices for a follower of Christ; namely not worshiping other
            gods, sexual immorality, and some other practices. The decision was “blinding” as it came from
            the Christian leadership at the time. Peter, James, Barnabas and the like were the people who
            generally lead after Jesus left earth. That and the Holy Spirit is said to have guided the apostles
            in making this choice, meaning it comes from God. Still to this day things such as the Ten
            Commandments given to Moses are still taught to children in Sunday school, despite it
            technically being part of Jewish law. A lot of Jewish laws today to a non Jew may seem kind of
            strange. Things like not mixing fabrics, not eating certain meat, not eating any meat from
            strangulated animals, and even things like homosexuality are seen as “whatever”. The Ten
            Commandments are still honored somewhat by Christian’s as those laws are sort of the
            baseline for a moral, faith centered life. Not killing people and not cheating on your wife are
            generally seen as good practices in society, and as such are followed.        </p>
