            Good works as well as belief in Christ's resurrection and acceptance of his presence in your life is what I’ve been told one needs to do in order to be ‘saved’. It’s a Sunday schoolanswer, and maybe not the most historical approach to things, but to me it makes sense. Jesus was a brown hippie who traveled around performing miracles such as healing, and feeding people. These are what I would consider to be ‘good works’. He in addition to that also preached of accepting him as the bread of life, or the water that never runs dry. Christians are called to act like Christ, and good works and professing his message are both cornerstones of an average day for Jesus.

            I think when Jesus told that rich man that it is easier to get a camel through the eye of the needle, than a rich man to heaven, he was not directly speaking about his money. Oftentimes with wealth comes a certain apathy towards the poor peoples suffering. This reads to me like Jesus is speaking on more than just having lots of money equals bad person. Having all your wealth, hoarding it, and never doing anything positive with it I believe is the deeper meaning of what he was saying. Later on as well I believe it is James, Jesus’ brother who says “faith without works is dead.” While not explicitly Jesus’ words, it’s pretty cut and clear. I AM ADDING MORE WORDS HERE. LOOK word count. Claiming to be a christian, while not following or living what Jesus teaches, isn’t what Jesus calls his followers to do. Jesus has many times stated that the law isn’t the be all end all to being a good person and entering God's kingdom. Rather loving God, and your neighbor seems to be far more important to The Son of God.
