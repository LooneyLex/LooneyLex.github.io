            Good works as well as belief in Christ's resurrection and acceptance of his presence in your life is what I’ve been told one needs to do in order to be ‘saved’. It’s a Sunday schoolanswer, and maybe not the most historical approach to things, but to me it makes sense. Jesuswas a brown hippie who traveled around performing miracles such as healing, and feeding people. These are what I would consider to be ‘good works’. He in addition to that also preached of accepting him as the bread of life, or the water that never runs dry. Christians are called to act like Christ, and good works and professing his message are both cornerstones of an average day for Jesus.

            Book two discusses signs, which I explained vaguely either. Augustine stresses thatunderstanding signs is very critical for understanding the Bible, as words are signs. Words are things, but they have meaning behind them. The Bible contains words, and those words have meanings deeper than their literal meaning. Figurative language is discussed as being a way tosay literal things in a far more beautiful way. Augustine argues one derives far greater satisfaction in their soul when interpreting Christ through a poetic lens, despite it not being as easy as reading a literal text. Loving God and your neighbor is discussed more in this book, as well as things. You can love things for what they are, he says. The final main point discussed is that the Bible is a book that teaches charity and humility, and as a Christian you should feel an obligation to help the less fortunate and live a humble life        </p>
