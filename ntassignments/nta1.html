            Augustus Caesar, or Octavian was emperor at the time. The Roman empire had pretty much secured control of the whole mediterranean region, including Egypt and all its wealth. There was relative peace in Rome in terms of war after all its civil wars. Octavian knew that people didn’t want to think of him as a warmonger or an emperor. He even offered to step back as Caesar, and that gained him more power. In order to seem as if he was a Republican in the people's eyes, Augustus rebuilt 82 temples, made taxes a thing, established firefighters, cleaned rivers,and even a postal service. A lot of construction was done under him as well. Things were far more connected than they had been under the previous administration. There was a lot of wealth for people in high government positions as well. Octavian made sure people who were loyal to him lived in luxury. Civilians were offered peace, stability and prosperity in exchange for their loyalty to Octavian. After the times of war that came before, normality and a sort of simple lifestyle became available to so many people of Rome.

         Neo on the other hand was a failure of an emperor compared to Octavian. People didn’t trust him, and Rome burned under him, literally and figuratively. Augustus had made people believe he was a humble ruler who valued republican ideology and lived a simple lifestyle. This was brilliant as it allowed for people to trust him far more, giving him what he truly had wanted. More and more power. This wasn’t bad for the people of Rome either, as things flourished under his rule as previously discussed. Despite him being “humble”, he still had a cult-like following. The Roman people admired his “simple” lifestyle. Simply put, Nero fumbled about with the people of Rome, while Octavian masterfully played and used them for his own gain.
