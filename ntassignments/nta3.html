            After reading the sources for this week, write a 1-2 paragraph essay that offers some observations about the process by which the books of the NT were accepted as "canonical". In other words, do you see any evidence of how these books were chosen? Are there any books listed in these early texts that do not make it into the canon of the NT?

            Finally, a more practical question might be if it took roughly 300 years for the complete canon of the NT to be recognized (Athanasius Easter Letter dates from 367 AD), what might have served as the basis for religious authority in those early days?

            Some of the observations I’ve made were that all books that were gonna be canonized needed to be closely related to the Apostles. Not necessarily written by them, just closely tied to them. This makes sense cuz these dudes knew Jesus. Orthodoxy was important, because you obviously wanna be right about stuff. The widespread use and acceptance of books is really important. If a book was good, but only people from Spain liked it, then it shouldn’t be canonized. I personally think this is a little silly, because what if this minority has something really important to bring to the table but you right it off due to it being a small group? I don’t think that became a real issue, as a lot of these local things were probably not all that orthodox which is more important. Holy spirit inspiration I would say is also pretty important, but I think there's less of a way of verifying that. The Gospel of Thomas and other Gnostic texts aren’t included, cuz Gnostic and Orthodox don’t go hand in hand.

            I would say the basis of religious faith before the New Testament had been decided on was likely the oldest member of your community. People who had had time to walk in the faith for a while, or had experienced stuff. I believe that there was a bishop too, and that would be a way to center around something. Truly, people are the essential part of the church, and as long as people can get together and pray, and read a book or two, that’s all that matters. Having a collective cannon is nice, and really standardizes the spread of christianity by making sure everyone is reading the same stuff, but in the early days it was kind of a miracle they had anything to read.
