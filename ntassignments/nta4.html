            In a two paragraph essay, see if you can discern a principle or two of biblical interpretation contained in the source readings for this week. Second, in looking at the Nicene and Apostles creeds what is one fundamental doctrine to which Christians historically must adhere?
        </p>

            Note: in answering this second question, pick something other than a belief in God -- which is perhaps the most obvious. Pick something that you did not expect to see or something that you had not considered before.)

            The biblical interpretation of Jesus’ importance is pretty solid. It would be rather ridiculous to argue he’s not important to christianity. That’s sort of a Sunday school answer though, so let's go a little deeper. The birth of Jesus is important as well, being mentioned in the Apostles and Nicene Creeds. His mom, Mary, being a virgin and giving birth to him is really important. This detail is likely due to the stigmas around sex, not to mention pre martial sex in the time in which this was written. Mary’s “pureness” so to speak is stressed. Accending to heaven after kicking sins ass is also mentioned in both. Basically we’ve covered all the Jesus holidays. Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter. The holy spirit is mentioned in both as well, as well as God, but not the trinity, at least not by name. I was always under the impression that the trinity and Jesus’ full humanity, yet full Godliness were both essential beliefs.

            It says both Christauins must believe in the catholic church, which isn’t really the same as what we know it today. Believing in the church is a weird concept, cuz like, what does that really imply? Following all of the church's teachings? Serving the church? Just knowing that it exists? It’s kinda silly, but I can get the need to include it. What is a religion without a power system and structure?
