            Saint Augustine of Hippo is an early first century theologian. His writings on Christianity are widely regarded as a great look into the history of early Christianity. Saint Augustine has many credentials, such as becoming the first archbishop of the Roman Catholic church. In book one he discusses ‘things.’ While this sounds incredibly vague and unhelpful, it’s actually an essential foundation for what he delves into in book 2. ‘Things’ as he classifies them are physical things in the world, that just are. They simply exist. A tree, a cow, a rock; however, things can hold signs, ] which we will discuss in greater detail when we cover book 2. For now, signs are things that contain a metaphorical or literal meaning; smoke is a sign, indicating that it is coming from a fire,a tree stump indicates a tree was fell, etc. The trinity is also discussed in book one, as being one of the few things you can love. Augustine is adamant that loving God and one's neighborare the two most important things one can do with their lives. He describes loving what’s above you - God - loving what you are, loving what’s near you - your neighbor- and what’s below you -less fortunate neighbors.

            Book two discusses signs, which I explained vaguely either. Augustine stresses thatunderstanding signs is very critical for understanding the Bible, as words are signs. Words are things, but they have meaning behind them. The Bible contains words, and those words have meanings deeper than their literal meaning. Figurative language is discussed as being a way tosay literal things in a far more beautiful way. Augustine argues one derives far greater satisfaction in their soul when interpreting Christ through a poetic lens, despite it not being as easy as reading a literal text. Loving God and your neighbor is discussed more in this book, as well as things. You can love things for what they are, he says. The final main point discussed is that the Bible is a book that teaches charity and humility, and as a Christian you should feel an obligation to help the less fortunate and live a humble life        </p>
