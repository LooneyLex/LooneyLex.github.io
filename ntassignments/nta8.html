            I had seen bits and pieces of the passion before class this week, but never the whole thing all the way through. It was about as graphic as I expected it to be. It’s always been strange that Christians choose to use the cross to represent their faith, often making it pretty and decorative. It’s strange because, ya know, it’s a brutal disgusting violent painful way to kill someone. If I was in the early church I would’ve probably gone with like, maybe the empty tomb? I think that’s a far more palatable and powerful image. Although it’s a lot harder to plaster on everything cuz it’s kinda just a cave. I really liked the focus on Mary and Jesus’ relationship within the film. It was really sweet to see. I know it’s not really the point of the film, but seeing some of Joseph - assuming he was still alive when Jesus died - would be really neat. Mother and son dynamics are really cool, but I’ve always preferred the father son one, albeit a bit more overdone in media.        </p>

            The brutality of what Jesus endured I think is the real centerpiece of the film, and the Passion as a whole. It wasn’t just him dying, it was humiliation, pain, and betrayal. That makes it so much harder, because like, if God told me “Hey, you’re my son, I need you to live a long prosperous life, and then die surrounded by loved ones and then the whole of humanity is saved from eternal damnation,” I think I’d take him up on this deal; however, throw in a beating, crucifying, and the like and I’m out. The willpower, and love shown by him is truly just crazy. The part about the random(?) guy off the street helping Jesus carry his cross was pretty powerful. Obviously the weight of the scene stands on its own, but the second meaning about helping a brother bare his burden, despite the pain it might cause you is beautiful. I swear, some of th stuff out of the Bible is just so poetic, even when it’s not actual poetry.
