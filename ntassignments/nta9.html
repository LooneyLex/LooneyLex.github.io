            Stephen was really wise, that's for sure. The Holy Spirit is definitely heavily associated with wisdom, specifically spiritual wisdom. Just by Stephen's words alone I think it’s fair to say there was something supernatural about the guy. Not to mention the next part but laying down your life for a belief is not easy, or normal. The bravery required to just sit there and let yourself be killed for your belief is a crazy commitment, and it’s fair to say that without some holy influence it’s near impossible. A lot of times when I hear people say the “holy spirit is with me” or some stuff like that I’m really skeptical. Like, nah I just think you think it is. You’re not out here getting stoned for nothing; however, if Stephen told me that, I’d believe that guy. Not only is he speaking like Jesus, he’s dying like him too. None of these old people who say they got the holy spirit are moving like that. It’s interesting too, as I don’t think any of the apostles really ‘sounded’ like Jesus so to speak. Especially not Paul. Small tangent, I don’t really like Paul's writing. It’s sort of repetitive and annoying. Like its some good content, but a lot of it feels like he's a high school student trying to hit a word count. That could be due to translations, but I digress. Stephen is the only early church member that I can recall truly ‘being’ like Jesus. The way he spoke confidently, doing ‘verbal backflips’ so to speak over the people questioning him, is just really Christlike. That’s one of my favorite parts about Jesus. Just how well spoken and educated sounding he is, for some poor carpenter in the Roman empire. Stephen replicated that super well, which I think is only possible with the presence of the Holy Spirit.
