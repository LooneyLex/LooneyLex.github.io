            The readings most certainly point to the fact that works are required to be a good Christian. I
think this makes sense, as Christians are called to live Christ-like lives, and what did he spend
most of his time doing? Crazy miracles and stuff. It wouldn’t make sense to say “As a Christian,
you can live like a bum and never help anyone.” Like, what's the point then? “Faith without
works is dead” has always made sense to me, because again, how could you even get a
reading of the bible that goes against that perspective? The OT Law is a lot different from the
“law” that the apostles sort of came up with. Obviously, there’s a lot that carries over from the
old Law, as some parts of it are just cornerstones of living a morally righteous life. Don’t kill,
don’t cheat on your wife, don’t steal; all of these are fairly standard. What was waved in favor of
the forgiveness offered by Jesus were mostly dietary laws, strange restrictions, and other things
that didn’t make sense. Not to say these are important for Jewish people, but rather if we’re
already getting rid of the need to be circumcised - a big Jewish law - then why bother with the
rest of it? Especially when Jesus himself was critical of the Pharisees for being holier than thou
due to their strict following of the law, while being generally mean and awful people. They were
only doing half of what they were told, rather than also doing good works for those less fortunate
than them, and Jesus makes it clear that that is the more important thing. He is constantly at
odds with the Jewish higher ups for the way they treat those less fortunate then themselves, so
it makes sense that his apostles would be advocating for a faith and works based world view.      </p>
