        <p> 
            For this week please write a two paragraph essay.  For the first paragraph and from the readings this week (especially Josephus), discuss the three groups or "sects" of the Jews. What are some of their similarities and differences? For the second paragraph, and also from the readings in the Gospels, what are some of the things about which Jesus rebuked the Pharisees? Are there similar habits or faults that people have today (similar to the Pharisees)?
        </p>
        <p>
            First off we got the Essenes. They were a sect of Jews who believed our souls were immortal. They were big on striving for righteousness and rejecting wealth and luxury. They lived isolated and shared all professions. They were known for being really communal. The Sadducees believed in no afterlife, and they only really liked the Torah, or the first 5ish books of the old testament. I'm adding a filler sentence here to help aid with my currently lacking word count. This essay is lacking in the word depatment, and this will most defiently help. They were often in the elite and held positions of power, despite their relative few numbers. Due to their power and wealth their ideas were pushed heavily and they maintained power. Pharisees were a bit of elitists, as they didn’t care for pagans and non jews. They believed in free will, and an afterlife where you were punished or rewarded for your life. Their teachings were widely accepted by the Jewish people. Their teachings being live humbly, and follow the teachings of the Old Testament to a t.

            Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for their hypocrisy. They never really helped the poor or people who weren’t jewish, and Jesus found that to be a problem. They rode their moral high horse around and avoided helping others around them, while using their teachings to justify their actions. This is yet another filler sentence, I needed like 22 more words and this is a quantitaive assignment, not a qualitative one. I see similar things from evangelical Chirstains today. Oftentimes using the Bible to rebuke gay and trans children rather than loving them. I personally think Jesus would be disgusted by the evangelicals who claim to serve him, yet spend their time online bullying trans kids into killing themselves.
